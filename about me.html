          I am a confident, intelligent and assertive young male. I aspire to
          obtain a career in the field of IT. My background experience is
          diverse and is not necessarily technical. This may be a disadvantage
          in many circumstances where technical knowledge and experience is
          needed. The industries and jobs i come from only get me to a certain
          level in IT. My dream job is either to become a Systems Developer or a
          Technical Support Engineer. These jobs do have entry level placements
          and provide opportunities to grow within the company. I have heard of
          middle and senior level jobs in those respective job titles. I have
          multiple hobbies that keep me busy and allow me to keep myself busy
          when i need to get my mind refreshed. I love to keep active and
          exercise on a regular basis. Motorcycles and racing have always
          motivated me to keep fit and train in the hope of one day competing
          professionally. They are expensive hobbies unfortunately, but the
          passion never dies.
