                  We got offered another learnership in Systems Development,
                  sponsored by ITQ Business Solutions. This was a very tough
                  learnership as we learnt information about programming and how
                  the internet works. This was helpful as when we started
                  learning different programming languages and how a database
                  works. We learnt languages like: HTML5, CSS, C#, SQL and
